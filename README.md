## ChromEMT-like analyis of simulated chromatin volumes

Commonly used functions (the main implementation of analysis workflow) is in ```chromemt_analysis.py```.

Code for replicating analysis results on ChromEMT data (Figure S13) can be found in ```replicate_chromemt.ipynb```.

Code for example images of simulation of experimental effects and boxplots of CVC and estimated diameters for real and simulated data (Figure S14) can be found in ```simulate_experimental_effects.ipynb``` and ```full_comparison_plots.ipynb```.
